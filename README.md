# Viktoria's bake house 

For my fourth milestone project with Code Institute I have created a full-stack restaurant website called Viktoria's bake house, using the Agile plannnig approach and CRUD operations through a relational database.

The website idea is to give the user a look at the menu options and to sign up and leave a like or comment for the competiton page.

# Target Audience

When planning this project, one important part was to consider what type of user audience this would attract
and what key featuers could I use to benift that audience.


 - People of any ages
 - People that enjoy food
 - People that injoy creativity with food
 - People that enjoy dinning out and fine dinning

 I wanted to find people that would enjoy more than eating a nice cake. But to go out and enjoy some fine dinning with a variety of classic and modern cakes. To keep things more interesting, I added a cake competition tot he website. Users can register and leave comment or just like the best of three cakes displayed every month.

# Scope

 I tried to take in to account that all ages can use the site, so simplicity is the main goal here. 

 - The header and footer of each page is kept the same throughout all the pages, to keep symetry and repetitive UX experience. 

 - The nav bar consists if three links, a home page, menu drop down link and a contact form.

 - A registration form for users to make an account. Users information is then saved in the data base. Once registered, a user can see clearly that they are logged in. When a used chooses to log out, a second reminded message is asked before the user fully commits to being logged out.

 - Three menu pages which can be created, updated and deleted by a site administrator. 

 - A blog page where users can read and post from a cake competition. Users that are registered can create, read, update and delete a post they have made.

 - A contact form where users can send a message that is saved in the data base and for the site administrator to read. User post request has been tested with MailTrap https://mailtrap.io/ for contormation that the email has been sent and received to am email provider.

# Structure

This website is made for three apps
1. Cake menus app - display menus
2. Blog app - post images and comments
3. Contact app - customer support

The menu, blog and contact apps all use a data base to store the users information. For this I have built 5 models.

---

# Data base

### Menu models
I have created three serpate models for the cake menus. Each model is identical with displaying information on cake name, description, dietary and allergens.
Once a product has been added to the data base, the site administor can select when the product is added to the menu with an on_menu option.
A created_on date is also logged to the data base for when the product was added and a time feild.

### Blog models

### Post model
This model consists of the follwing fields for a site administrator:
- A title and matching slug field

- Description field in which I installed Django summernotes libary for better text styling

- Status option for a darft post which is not posted or a pulished option to display the post

- An updated on field giving a date and time

- Feature image for an image to be uploaded with the post

- Approved field to give a final approval to diplay the post

- Likes function of the user to like a post

I wanted the administrator to control what was being posted and for future development, a user will get the option to post their own cakes.

### Comments model
This model is focused towards the user to display a comment. The model is controlled with the administors panel in the back end.
I wanted all post to be approved this way before being posted.
The data fields consist of the following:

- A CASCADE on delete function for when a comment is deleted by the user, is will be deleted from the data base also.
This is following django'sway of maintainind data integrity.

- Name field for a user to a their name, and a minimum of 80 characters

- an email feild for users email

- a body text field for the user to add a comemnt

- Created on to give a date and time of the post

- Approved option for the site administrator to approve to be posted

I have tried to follow some of the modern techniques within a comment being shown. By adding a time, date, like and to unlike a post. 

![](assets/Comment%20model.png)

### Contact 
The contact form is more towards a general enquiryâ€™s form. For this reason I wanted the enquiry to be sent to the database.

I have added the following fields:

- Name - Customers full name 

- Email - Customers email

- Messgae - input box text field for any enquiries 

- Not read - for administrative purposes to show now read

- read - for administrative purposes to select when the enquiry ahs been read

# Design

---

# Base page

I wanted a symmetric feel throughout all pages with the website. To do this I created a base html page that extend its content of a header and footer on all pages. 


### Home page
 After getting good design ideas and information from https://elementor.com/blog/, who review website designs. I decided to keep a blank canvas in white for a background colour and then add colour with images.

I used a header image of a width of 100% to stretch across the whole screen on all devices. I want the image to give a good idea as to what the site is about, so choosing the correct imagine was inportant. I aslo added a fixed position to give a srolling effect for this image.

![](assets/home%20page%20header.png)

--- 

### Nav bar
The navigation bar for my site uses three links, home page, cake menus and a contact form. I have added a mouse over effect to change the colour of the text when the mouse cursor is on the link. This gives a user an indication that they about the use that link.

I have given a drop down menu for the all menu pages. This keepsthe nav bar small and with more functions.

![](assets/nav%20bar.png)

For screen sizes of 900 piexls and smaller, the Navigation bar drops the collapseible button and  all three links can be accessed from there. This is keeping with modern UX design as most webpages are viewed on a mobile platform today.

![](assets/mobile%20screen%20size%20nav%20abr.png)


---

### Footer
For a footer, I have given imformtaion on the opening hours, a google map of the location form which a user can view, an address and three common socail media links for the them to use and follow the webiste. I kept a white background using a line break effect to apply a speprate section of the page. 

![](assets/footer.png)

For screen sizes of 900 pixels and smaller, the footer section will reduce it's size of content and be stacked on top of one another to keep a modern UX design. 

![](assets/mobile%20screen%20size%20footer.png)

---

### Cake competition 
The competition section, I decied to keep it with the landing page. I wanted bring more colour to this part of the page, so by adding pictures with bright and vibrant colours it adds a good amount of colour. I added some text under the images to give a little more input of what to expecpt from the description above.

![](assets/Competition%20section.png)

For screen sizes 900 and below, I have followed modern designs and stacked images on top of one another. I keep the images at a larger display to give a user a better feel to the image on a smaller screen. 

![](assets/blog%20section%20mobile%20scrren%20size.png)

---

### Blog page
The blog page this is one of the main interests I believe that a user would like to visit on the website. I wanted to keep simplistically on this page as I have done throughout the website. Going by modern desgin ideas on a browser and table screen size and with the help from https://elementor.com/blog/, I have placed the image to the left and  the post detail section to the right. When reviewing sites such as FaceBook https://www.facebook.com/ and Instagram https://www.instagram.com/ I had noticed when adding a comment, it removes the user out of site from the image that they are commenting one. For better UX in my option, I would like the user to see the image when adding a comment. I my opinion tis gives a easy way to think about what to right not having to forget what the image looks like.

![](assets/post%20detail%20page.png)

YOU NEED TO STYLE THE BLOG PAGE FOR MOBILE SCREEN SIZE!!!!!!!

### Edit blog page
When a user wants to edit a post, they are sent to a seperate page in which they can add or delete their psot in a simple form. This form layout stays the same when reducing to a smaller screen size.

![](assets/mobile%20edit%20post%20html.png)

### Menu

With the menu pages I decied to postion the text in the center of the page for a better readable view on bigger screens. I use a couple of differnt font familys and font sizes to break up the layout as the menu only consists of text. 

I used three seperate pages for the menus as I wanted to keep the three cake type separate and to give an easier structure for reading each menu. I have added a product title, description, dietary and allergies information clearly within the menu on each product.

![](assets/menus%20-%20page.png)

For screen sizes at 900 pixels and smaller, the menu uses a Bootstrap container to help keep text within a readable size and layout. For a mobile device, the text will be positioned to the left to give a better reader frendly experience.

![](assets/mobile%20menu%20page.png)

---

### Contact Page
I wanted the contact for to be tested for a POST request. I used a free email service to test that the contact form can be sent to the provider.
I used a MailTrap.io https://mailtrap.io/
