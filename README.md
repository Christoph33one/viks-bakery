# Viktoria's bake house 

For my fourth milestone project with Code Institute I have created a full-stack restaurant website called Viktoria's bake house, using the Agile plannnig approach and CRUD operations through a relational database.

The website idea is to give the user a look at the menu options and to sign up and leave a like or comment for the competiton page.

# Target Audience

When planning this project, one important part was to consider what type of user audience this would attract
and what key featuers could I use to benift that audience.


 - People of any ages
 - People that enjoy food
 - People that injoy creativity with food
 - People that enjoy dinning out and fine dinning

 I wanted to find people that would enjoy more than eating a nice cake. But to go out and enjoy some fine dinning with a variety of classic and modern cakes. To keep things more interesting, I added a cake competition tot he website. Users can register and leave comment or just like the best of three cakes displayed every month.

# Scope

 I tried to take in to account that all ages can use the site, so simplicity is the main goal here. 

 - The header and footer of each page is kept the same throughout all the pages, to keep symetry and repetitive UX experience. 

 - The nav bar will send a user to the required pages label within the nav bar. I have given a drop down menu for the all menu pages. This keepsthe nav bar small and with more functions. 

 - A registration form for users to make an account. Users information is then saved in the data base. Once registered, a user can see clearly that they are logged in. When a used chooses to log out, a second reminded message is asked before the user fully commits to being logged out.

 - Three menu pages which can be created, updated and deleted by a site administrator. 

 - A blog page where users can read and post from a cake competition. Users that are registered can create, read, update and delete a post they have made.

 - A contact form where users can send a message that is saved in the data base and for the site administrator to read.

# Structure

This website is made for three apps
1. Cake menus app - display menus
2. Blog app - post images and comments
3. Contact app - customer support

The menu, blog and contact apps all use a data base to store the users information. For this I have built 5 models.

# Data base

### Menu models
I have created three serpate models for the cake menus. Each model is identical with displaying information on cake name, description, dietary and allergens.
Once a product has been added to the data base, the site administor can select when the product is added to the menu with an on_menu option.
A created_on date is also logged to the  data base for when the product was added and a time feild.

### Blog models

### Post model
This model consists of the follwing fields for a site administrator:
- A title and matching slug field

- Description field in which I installed Django summernotes libary for better text styling

- Status option for a darft post which is not posted or a pulished option to display the post

- An updated on field giving a date and time

- Feature image for an image to be uploaded with the post

- Approved field to give a final approval to diplay the post

- Likes function of the user to like a post

I wanted the administrator to control what was being posted and for future development, a user will get the option to post their own cakes.

### Comments model
This model is focused towards the user to display a comment. The model is controlled with the administors panel in the back end.
I wanted all post to be approved this way before being posted.
The data fields consist of the following:

- A CASCADE on delete function for when a comment is deleted by the user, is will be deleted from the data base also.
This is following django'sway of maintainind data integrity.

- Name field for a user to a their name, and a minimum of 80 characters

- an email feild for users email

- a body text field for the user to add a comemnt

- Created on to give a date and time of the post

- Approved option for the site administrator to approve to be posted

I have tried to follow some of the modern techniques within a comment being shown. By adding a time, date, like and to unlike a post.

### Contact 
The contact form is more towards a general enquiryâ€™s form. For this reason I wanted the enquiry to be sent to the database.

I have added the following fields:

- Name - Customers full name 

- Email - Customers email

- Messgae - input box text field for any enquiries 

- Not read - for administrative purposes to show now read

- read - for administrative purposes to select when the enquiry ahs been read

# Design

---

# Base page

- nav bar & header

- Footer

# Home page
- After getting good design ideas and information from https://elementor.com/blog/, who review website designs. I decided to keep a blank canvas in white for a background colour and then add colour with images.

I wanted the contact for to be tested for a POST request. I used a free email service to test that the contact form can be sent to the provider.
