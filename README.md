# Target Audience

When planning this project, one important part was to consider what type of user audience this would attract
and what key featuers could I use to benift that audience.


 - People of any ages
 - People that enjoy food
 - People that injoy creativity with food
 - People that enjoy dinning out and fine dinning

 I wanted to find people that would enjoy more than eating a nice cake. But to go out and enjoy some fine dinning with a variety of classic and modern cakes. To keep things more interesting, I added a cake competition tot he website. Users can register and leave comment or just like the best of three cakes displayed every month.

# Scope

### Structure

 I tried to take in to account that all ages can use the site, so simplicity is the main goal here. 

 - The header and footer of each page is kept the same throughout all the pages, to keep symetry and repetitive UX experience. 

 - The nav bar will send a user to the required pages label within the nav bar. I have given a drop down menu for the all menu pages. This keepsthe nav bar small and with more functions. 

 - A registration form for users to make an account. Users information is then saved in the data base. Once registered, a user can see clearly that they are logged in. When a used chooses to log out, a second reminded message is asked before the user fully commits to being logged out.

 - Three menu pages which can be created, updated and deleted by a site administrator. 

 - A blog page where users can read and post from a cake competition. Users that are registered can create, read, update and delete a post they have made.

 - A contact form where users can send a message that is saved in the data base and for the site administrator to read.

# Design

### Home page
- After getting good design ideas and information from https://elementor.com/blog/, who review website designs. I decided to keep a blank canvas in white for a background colour and then add colour with images.
