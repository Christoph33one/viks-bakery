# Target Audience

When planning this project, one important part was to consider what type of user audience this would attract
and what key featuers could I use to benift that audience.


 - People of any ages
 - People that enjoy food
 - People that injoy creativity with food
 - People that enjoy dinning out and fine dinning

 I wanted to find people that would enjoy more than eating a nice cake. But to go out and enjoy some fine dinning with a variety of classic and modern cakes.
